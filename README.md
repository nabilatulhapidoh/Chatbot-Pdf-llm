Large Language Models (LLM), or Large Language Models, are the latest achievements in the field of artificial intelligence that utilize machine learning technology to understand and generate text with a high level of complexity. The LLM brings the unique ability to process and understand linguistic context in multiple languages, as well as produce text that is often difficult to distinguish from human writing.
Using deep learning techniques and very large model architectures, LLM can tackle tasks such as language translation, creative text generation, and understanding context in natural language. The model is trained on incredibly large amounts of data, enabling it to recognize complex patterns and store knowledge across domains.
